# Stage1and2Recycling
According to Lauren Cutlip, business development and outreach manager at the Recycling & Disposal Solutions of Virginia, there are stages to the recycling process (see https://brightly.eco/recycling-process/).  
<br/>“When the driver completes their route, they arrive at the [MRF] to be weighed in on the scale before unloading the recyclable materials onto the tip floor,” Cutlip says. “Then a loader operator will scoop the materials and fill a drum feed or hopper where the items are mixed up and brought to the presort belt where staff looks for [non-recyclable] items that could damage equipment or contaminate the end product (including wood, clothing, plastic bags, scrap metal, and food waste).”
<br/>“The materials travel through a series of mechanical sorting steps, which in the case of the RDS Roanoke single-stream facility include an OCC screen where cardboard travels up onto its own conveyor, a fine screen where glass drops out, a news screen where 2D paper is separated from 3D containers, an optical sorter that pulls out PET bottles, an overhead magnet for steel and tin cans, AMP robots that pull off HDPE containers, and—finally—an eddy current that repels aluminum cans into their designated bunker.”
<br/>I break this down into Stage1 and Stage 2, respectively.  The idea is to build a computer vision model for each of the stages.  Perhaps Stage 1 model could make the staff's work safer by first having robots remove all objects about which they are reasonably certain.  
<br/></br> I've scraped most of the data using fastai's search_images function.  
<br/>To make the model better, I would like to get more high quality images in each category, but especially some images to help differentiate plastic and glass bottles (right now a tilt in a bottle's image can 'fool' a model into thinking it's glass even if it's plastic and a 'straight' image of a plastic bottle can be mistaken as glass) as well as paper and cardboard.
